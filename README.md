## 🗃️ Dataset

Due to GitHub file size limits, the dataset (`Fake.csv` and `True.csv`) is not included in this repository.

You can download it from Kaggle:
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

Place the `Fake.csv` and `True.csv` files inside your project folder before running the code.
